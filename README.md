Easy 1: 
The length_of_last_word function takes a string s as input and returns the length of the last word in the string. The function uses a simple loop to iterate through the characters of the string from right to left.
The code is explained as follows:
Set last_word_length to 0 at startup. The length of the previous word will be kept in this variable.
With a step of -1, begin iterating through the characters in the string starting from the last character (len(s) - 1) and ending with the first character (-1).

Verify whether the character being typed is a space (' '):
The function returns the length of the last word if it is a space and last_word_length is greater than 0. This indicates that we have located the last word's end.

We continue iterating if it is a space and last_word_length = 0, which indicates that we are still running into consecutive spaces at the end of the string.
Increase last word length by 1 if the current character is not a space, signifying that we are still within the last word.
If the loop completes without encountering a space, it means the entire string is a single word, and the function returns the length of that word.

Easy 3:
The generate function takes an integer numRows as input and returns a list of lists representing the first numRows of Pascal's triangle. The function uses recursion to build the Pascal's triangle row by row.

Explanation of the code:
The base case is when numRows is 1. In this case, the function returns [[1]] as the first row of Pascal's triangle.
If numRows is greater than 1, the function recursively calls itself with numRows - 1 to generate the Pascal's triangle for one less row.
The last row of the previously generated Pascal's triangle is retrieved as last_row.
A new row is generated by summing pairs of adjacent elements in the last_row. The list comprehension [last_row[i] + last_row[i + 1] for i in range(len(last_row) - 1)] performs this operation.
The new row is then inserted with a '1' at the beginning and at the end, representing the first and last elements of Pascal's triangle rows.
The newly generated row is appended to the Pascal's triangle, and the updated Pascal's triangle is returned.

Medium 2:
The majorityElement function takes an integer array nums as input and returns a list of elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times, where n is the length of the input array. The function uses a dictionary (counts) to keep track of the counts of each element in the array.

Explanation of the code:
Initialize n as the length of the input array nums and calculate the threshold as ⌊ n/3 ⌋. This threshold represents the minimum number of occurrences an element must have to be considered a majority element.
Initialize an empty list candidates to store the elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.
Initialize an empty dictionary counts to keep track of the counts of each element in the array.
Iterate through each element (num) in the array nums:
If num is not in the counts dictionary, add it with an initial count of 0.
Increment the count of the current element in the counts dictionary.
Check if the count of the current element is greater than the threshold and if the element is not already in the candidates list. If both conditions are met, add the element to the candidates list.
After iterating through all elements, return the candidates list containing the elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.
