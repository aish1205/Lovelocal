Easy 1: 
The length_of_last_word function calculates the length of the last word in a given string s.
Explanation of how it works:

s.strip(): Removes leading and trailing whitespaces from the string s. This ensures that any spaces at the beginning or end of the string are ignored.

split(): Splits the string into a list of words based on whitespace. This effectively breaks the string into words.
[-1]: Selects the last element (word) from the list of words obtained after the split.

len(...): Calculates the length of the last word.

The function works by leveraging the strip and split methods to handle leading/trailing spaces and split the string into words. Then, it extracts the last word and calculates its length using len.

Easy 3:
The generate function takes an integer numRows as input and returns a list of lists representing the first numRows of Pascal's triangle. The function uses recursion to build the Pascal's triangle row by row.

Explanation of the code:
The base case is when numRows is 1. In this case, the function returns [[1]] as the first row of Pascal's triangle.
If numRows is greater than 1, the function recursively calls itself with numRows - 1 to generate the Pascal's triangle for one less row.
The last row of the previously generated Pascal's triangle is retrieved as last_row.
A new row is generated by summing pairs of adjacent elements in the last_row. The list comprehension [last_row[i] + last_row[i + 1] for i in range(len(last_row) - 1)] performs this operation.
The new row is then inserted with a '1' at the beginning and at the end, representing the first and last elements of Pascal's triangle rows.
The newly generated row is appended to the Pascal's triangle, and the updated Pascal's triangle is returned.

Medium 2:
The majorityElement function takes an integer array nums as input and returns a list of elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times, where n is the length of the input array. The function uses a dictionary (counts) to keep track of the counts of each element in the array.

Explanation of the code:
Initialize n as the length of the input array nums and calculate the threshold as ⌊ n/3 ⌋. This threshold represents the minimum number of occurrences an element must have to be considered a majority element.
Initialize an empty list candidates to store the elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.
Initialize an empty dictionary counts to keep track of the counts of each element in the array.
Iterate through each element (num) in the array nums:
If num is not in the counts dictionary, add it with an initial count of 0.
Increment the count of the current element in the counts dictionary.
Check if the count of the current element is greater than the threshold and if the element is not already in the candidates list. If both conditions are met, add the element to the candidates list.
After iterating through all elements, return the candidates list containing the elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.
